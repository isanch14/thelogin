      The Web is everywhere: from your favorite connected device (mobile phone,
      pad, etc.) to your future connected car and home. The Web is also changing
      the landscape in healthcare, financial and government services, as well as
      commerce, arts and education. As such, the Web design and development
      industry is an attractive growing professional career path. With so many
      companies and organizations depending on their online presence these days,
      the people who design, develop, and manage Web sites are in high demand –
      a trend that is unlikely to change anytime soon. According to the Bureau
      of Labor Statistics, employment of Web developers in the US is projected
      to grow 27% from 2014 to 2024, which is much faster than the average for
      all occupations. And, this trend can also be seen in other parts of the
      world. For example, I work in Sophia Antipolis, the “French Riviera’s
      Silicon Valley”, where a vast amount of companies are looking for
      candidates with Web design and development expertise. So, whether you are
      just starting your professional life or embarking on a new chapter, career
      prospects are endless in this industry and include: Front-End Developer,
      Web App Developer, Web Designer, Web Integrator and Web Content
      Strategist, just to name a few. These are the hottest jobs around. And,
      the average salary for front-end Web developers in the US is $108,874. W3C
      “makes” the Web: it creates the standard technologies that are the
      foundational bricks of the Web. Our Front-End Web Developer Professional
      Certificate program offers high quality courses that will help you
      understand and acquire the rigor of Web programming. We offer unique
      expertise, combining know-how and interactive coding examples on CSS,
      HTML, and JavaScript. You will get hands on experience from simple and fun
      projects, so that you actually learn to code. You will practice a
      multitude of skills, from drawing, animating and embedding audio and video
      to gaming and filling a form. W3C is also making the Web better – for
      everyone. W3C produces guidelines to help broaden the audience and improve
      the user experience for all users, no matter their culture, language or
      disabilities. Everyone should have access to the Web. Today, fewer than
      one third of current Web users speak English as their native language and
      that proportion will only continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and
      more communities of limited English proficiency. Similarly, Web
      accessibility is increasingly important to many organizations and
      governments from around the world, and has many business benefits, as it
      benefits those with and without disabilities. All of these guidelines and
      more are provided in our Professional Certificate program to help you not
      only learn how to code right but also be part of a Web community, which
      builds a Web we all want and can use. The goal of the W3C’s Front-End Web
      Developer Professional Certificate program is to empower Web developers to
      author better Web sites, apps and games. You will learn how to use all
      client-side Web development techniques to create and innovate on the Web.
      Even artists are using the Web to express their creativity! Last March,
      W3Cx ran a couple of #webdev contests. Using Web technologies only, and
      building on the examples that are shown in W3Cx courses, participants were
      asked to develop either a 2D shmup (Shoot ’em up) game or an application
      proposing a real-time 2D or 3D music visualization. We happily found out
      that the contests winners did not have a Web programming background per
      se, but were using Web technologies to passionately showcase and
      illustrate their hobbies. The winners worked in professions such as a
      mathematician, electrician, creative director and musician! In fast moving
      industries such as Web development, staying on top of the curve as a great
      Web developer means that you should never stop learning. Employers are
      always looking for developers to be up to speed on the latest and greatest
      technologies. The W3C Front-End Web Developer professional certificate
      program gives you up-to-date, essential skills to start or advance your
      career. Hear from our previous learners and learn how they found career
      success with our courses.
